B. [X] Create model
C. [X] Train model
D. [X] Test model
E. [X] Implement strategy
F. [ ] Write article


A. Get data bucket
[ X ] Write function to request data -> It needs testing
[ X ] Get stock list -> It needs to check which is available through the API
[ X ] Data storage -> raw, cleaned, model ready
[ X ] Decide input features (OHLC, volume, technical indicators)
[ ? ] Normalize/scale data for the model
[ X ] Prepare data to use sliding window
[ X ] Implement sliding window to the data

B. Create model bucket
[ X ] Define LSTM architecture (number of layers, units per layer
[ X ] Add dropout layers (to prevent overfitting)
[ X ] Define activation functions
[ X ] Choose optimizer and loss function

C. Train model bucket
[ X ] Split data into training and validation sets for sliding windows
[ ? ] Implement early stopping/callbacks
[ X ] Train on historical data
[ X ] Save training checkpoints
[ X ] Log performance metrics during training (loss, accuracy)
[ ? ] Fine-tune model hyperparameters (number of epochs, batch side)

D. Test model bucket
[ X ] Evaluate on test set (ensure no data leakage)
[ X ] Visualize prediction vs. actuals
[ X ] Measure performance (accuracy, MSE)
[ X ] Calculate trading returns based on model output
[ X ] Assess model robustness

E. Implement strategy bucket
[ X ] Define long short trading logic based on model predictions
[ X ] Simulate trades with trading scripts
[ ? ] Fine-tune strategy parameters (stop loss, take profit levels)
[ X ] Measure overall strategy performance (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown): tearsheet

F. Write article bucket
[ X ] Introduction to LSTM in stock trading
[ X ] Write literature review
[+/-] Explain data source process
[+/-] Explain model creation and key architectural choices
[   ] Discuss model training challenges and tuning process
[   ] Share results of testing, and strategy performance
[   ] Conclusion with insights and next steps
