Big Buckets
A. [X] Get data
B. [X] Create model
C. [ ] Train model
D. [ ] Test model
E. [ ] Implement strategy
F. [ ] Write article


A. Get data bucket
[ X ] Write function to request data -> It needs testing
[ X ] Get stock list -> It needs to check which is available through the API
[ X ] Data storage -> raw, cleaned, model ready
[ X ] Decide input features (OHLC, volume, technical indicators)
[ ? ] Normalize/scale data for the model
[ X ] Prepare data to use sliding window
[ X ] Implement sliding window to the data

B. Create model bucket
[ X ] Define LSTM architecture (number of layers, units per layer
[ X ] Add dropout layers (to prevent overfitting)
[ X ] Define activation functions
[ X ] Choose optimizer and loss function

C. Train model bucket
[ X ] Split data into training and validation sets for sliding windows
[   ] Implement early stopping/callbacks
[   ] Train on historical data
[   ] Save training checkpoints
[   ] Log performance metrics during training (loss, accuracy)
[   ] Fine-tune model hyperparameters (number of epochs, batch side)

D. Test model bucket
[   ] Evaluate on test set (ensure no data leakage)
[   ] Visualize prediction vs. actuals
[   ] Measure performance (accuracy, MSE)
[   ] Calculate trading returns based on model output
[   ] Assess model robustness

E. Implement strategy bucket
[+/-] Define long short trading logic based on model predictions
[+/-] Simulate trades with trading program
[   ] Fine-tune strategy parameters (stop loss, take profit levels)
[   ] Measure overall strategy performance (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown): tearsheet

F. Write article bucket
[+/-] Introduction to LSTM in stock trading
[+/-] Write literature review
[+/-] Explain data source process
[+/-] Explain model creation and key architectural choices
[   ] Discuss model training challenges and tuning process
[   ] Share results of testing, and strategy performance
[   ] Conclusion with insights and next steps
